# Devanagari-Character-Recognition
I have used convolutional neural networks  for create the model. 

Code Requirements
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.
For this project you need to install Keras , Tensorflow , Numpy Libraries. 

Python Implementation
1. Dataset- DHCD (Devnagari Character Dataset)
2. Images of size 32 X 32
3. Convolutional Network Support added.

I have upload the model. Architecture of this model is given below  

Architecture :   CONV2D -->CONV2D--> MAXPOOL --> CONV2D-->CONV2D --> MAXPOOL -->DROPOUT-->FLATTEN-->FC -->Softmax  

Accuracy of this model is ~98%  

In this project I have upload the python code that will recognise the characters ad digits of Devanagari Lipi   

Description : This code successfully recognises hindi characters and digits.
